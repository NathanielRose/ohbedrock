SPK commands reference:
- [Project Management](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/master/docs/project-management.md)

Relevant commands:
- `spk project init`
- `spk project create-variable-group`
- `spk project install-lifecycle-pipeline`
- Run `bash /scripts/setup.sh create` (Creates a resource group, storage account, table, and adds variables to variable group)
- `spk project install-lifecycle-pipeline`

## Steps
Setting up the manifest generation pipeline that converts HLDs in the [voting-hld repo](0.md) to manifests in the [voting-manifest repo](0.md) consists of:
