### Challenge 3: App to HLD and ACR DevOps
Objective: Automate generating HLDs from an application repository.

Goal: Set up a Bedrock project with the `app -> hld` (lifecycle-pipeline) pipeline

- [Service Management in Bedrock](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/390acbc8ab3ed20082bd50657eab16402e37144c/docs/project-service-management-guide.md)

SPK commands reference:
- [Project Management](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/master/docs/project-management.md)

Relevant commands:
- `spk project init`
- `spk project create-variable-group`
- `spk project install-lifecycle-pipeline`
- Run `bash /scripts/setup.sh create` (Creates a resource group, storage account, table, and adds variables to variable group)
- `spk project install-lifecycle-pipeline`

## Steps
Setting up the pipeline that adds HLDs to the HLD repository consists of:
1. Initializing a [Bedrock project](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/390acbc8ab3ed20082bd50657eab16402e37144c/docs/project-service-management-guide.md#application-repositories) in the application repository (`voting-app`) which was created in [Challenge 0](0.md)
2. Setting up a [variable group](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/master/docs/project-management.md#create-variable-group) for the Bedrock project.
3. Installing the [lifecycle-pipeline](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/master/docs/project-management.md#install-lifecycle-pipeline)
