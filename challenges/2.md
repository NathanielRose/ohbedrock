### Challenge 2: HLD to resource manifests DevOps
Objective: Automate generating resource manifests from HLDs.

Goal: Set up the `hld -> manifests` pipeline via `spk`

SPK commands reference:
- [HLD Management](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/390acbc8ab3ed20082bd50657eab16402e37144c/docs/hld-management.md)

Relevant commands:
- `spk hld init`
- `spk hld install-manifest-pipeline`

## Steps
Setting up the manifest generation pipeline that converts HLDs in the [voting-hld repo](0.md) to manifests in the [voting-manifest repo](0.md) consists of:
1. [Get required resources](#get-required-resources)
2. [Initialize SPK](#initialize-spk)
3. Deploy the manifest generation pipeline
4. [Update Flux GitOps path](#update-flux-gitops-path)

### Get required resources
To deploy a manifest generation pipeline you will need:
1. Personal Access Token in Azure DevOps with this permissions:
   - Build (Read & execute)
   - Code (Read, write, & manage)
   - Variable Groups (Read, create, & manage)
   To create one, follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).
2. An [spk-config.yaml](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/390acbc8ab3ed20082bd50657eab16402e37144c/spk-config.yaml)
3. HLD repo (from [Challenge 0](0.md)).
4. Manifest repo (from [Challenge 0](0.md)).

### Initialize SPK
From the [spk-config.yaml](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/blob/390acbc8ab3ed20082bd50657eab16402e37144c/spk-config.yaml) fill out the values for the `azure_devops` section.

**Note:** This spk-config.yaml should not be commited anywhere, as it contains sensitive credentials.

Run `spk init -f <spk-config.yaml>` where <spk-config.yaml> the path to the configuation file.

### Update Flux GitOps path
In [Challenge 1](1-0.md), Flux was configured with the root directory as a GitOps path.
