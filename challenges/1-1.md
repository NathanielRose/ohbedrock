### Challenge 1.1: Resource Manifest
Objective: Understand the pros and cons of working with raw resource manifests

Goal: Make a change to the voting app resource manifest. Verify it was automatically deployed via GitOps.

Steps:
- Change the docker image tag for the voting app from `v2` to `v3` in the `azure-vote.yaml`. New image name: `edsa14/azure-vote-front:v3`
- Push the change to the repository

The v3 application should have the title in blue:
![voting app v3](./images/azure-vote-v3.png)
