### Challenge 1: GitOps and AKS
Objective: Understand GitOps. Refer to [A first Workload with Bedrock](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/tree/docs_spk/docs/firstWorkload).

Goals:
- Deploy a Bedrock single key-vault cluster
- Deploy the Azure voting app resource manifest

- [GitOps - Operations by Pull Request](https://www.weave.works/blog/gitops-operations-by-pull-request)
- [SPK](https://github.com/CatalystCode/spk/tree/390acbc8ab3ed20082bd50657eab16402e37144c)

## Steps
### Setup prerequisites
To deploy a single key-vault cluster using `spk` you will need the following:
1. Service principal
2. Storage account
3. Storage account access key
4. Resource group

The [scripts/infra-setup.sh](./scripts/infra-setup.sh) creates this for you.

To run:
```
cd scripts
bash infra-setup.sh
```

This creates two files:
- service-principal.json
- infra-values.txt

### Deploy cluster
To 

- Deploy a kubernetes single key-vault cluster with flux via `spk`
- Clone the `voting-manifest` repo that was created in the previous challenge
- Push the [azure-vote.yaml](azure-vote.yaml)(resource manifest file) for the voting app in the `voting-manifest` repository.


### Challenge 1.1: Resource Manifest
Objective: Understand the pros and cons of working with raw resource manifests

Goal: Make a change to the voting app resource manifest. Verify it was automatically deployed via GitOps.

Steps:
- Change the docker image tag for the voting app from `v1` to `v3` in the `azure-vote.yaml`. New image name: `edsa14/azure-vote-front:v2`
- Push the change to the repository

The v3 application should have the title in blue:
![voting app v2](./images/azure-vote-v2.png)


### Challenge 1.2: Helm (optional)
Objective: Generate a resource manifest from a helm chart

Goal: Get a basic understanding of the pros/cons of Helm.

Suggested reading:
- [Deploying and Maintaining Infrastructure](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/docs_spk/docs/infrastructure.md)

Steps:
- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/edaena/helm-charts) with the helm chart for the azure voting app. 
- `cd helm-charts`
- `helm template ./azure-vote`
- Change the image tag in `values.yaml` to `v3`
- `helm template ./azure-vote`

Verify that the generated resource manifest has the `v2` image tag.


### Challenge 1.3: From Helm to High Level Deployment Definitions
Objective: Generate resource manifests for different environments from an HLD.

Goal: Understand the benefits of using HLDs for large applications for different deployment environments.

Suggested reading:
- [High Level Deployment Definitions](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/blob/docs_spk/docs/high-level-definitions.md)
- [Build Fabrikate Definition for Container Deployment](https://github.com/microsoft/bedrock/tree/docs_spk/docs/fabrikate)

Steps:
- Clone the [Azure voting app HLD repository](https://github.com/edaena/azure-vote-hld)
- `fab install`
- `fab generate common`
- `fab generate prod`

Compare the `common` and `prod` manifests.
